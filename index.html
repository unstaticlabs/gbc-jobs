          <h2>What Is The Good Boys Club?</h2>
          <p>
            The Good Boys Club is a positive, affirming space for submissive
            men. GBC is a brand, a community, and a cultural platform. We build
            trust, shared taste, social signal, and belonging. The goal is a
            safe, fun, creative space of freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why list non-GBC roles here?</strong>
            Because the DNA overlaps. If you belong here, you may also be
            exactly who we need to help shape the tools, products, and social
            infrastructure around it.

          <h2>The Bigger Vision</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Hey! I'm SBFH.</strong>
            I'm an engineer, a kinky sub boy, and a content creator. My main
            driver is freedom, and I'm building toward the next version of the
            internet: a free web for communities. My beliefs and values are well
            summarized in the "Fuck The VCs"
            <a
              href="https://fuckthevcs.com/#/manifesto"

              rel="noreferrer"
              >manifesto</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            This journey will not be easy. We're going up against much bigger
            players. But we cannot win if we do not play. At least, we can have
            fun trying.
          </p>
          <p>
            It starts with claiming our humanity: building community and owning
            back our identities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to build a space online where we can be ourselves, and where
            we can be free.

              <p>
                <strong>Good Boys Club</strong> is home. This layer is not
                mainly about tech. It is about people, culture, safety, and
                belonging. We are building a positive, affirming space for
                submissive men.

              <h3>Social Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Smash</strong> is a 1:N messaging and curated
                content-sharing protocol. Users own their identities and data.
                With interoperable identity, they can join multiple
                <strong>neighborhoods</strong>. Like in the real world,
                neighborhoods are where people meet and communities form.

              <h3>Human Connection</h3>
              <p>
                Social networks became less and less social.
                <strong>KinkVerse</strong> aims to bring back human connection:
                a neighborhood built for kinksters, by kinksters. Long term, the
                KinkVerse's neighborhood governance should belong to the
                community. Enough of opportunistic capitalists taking over our
                communities and culture.

              <h3>Content Creation</h3>
              <p>
                Content creation is now a major part of the web. We are building
                tools that help creators become more resilient and own their
                content. A nice side effect: it also makes my life as a creator
                much easier.
