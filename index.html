        <h2>What Is The Good Boys Club?</h2>
        <p>
          The Good Boys Club is a brand, a community, and a cultural platform. It builds trust, shared taste, social
          signal, and belonging. It is also the front door for hiring people aligned with a bigger build.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why list non-GBC roles here? Because the talent overlap is real. The people who resonate with GBC culture are
          often exactly the builders needed in Yoshi, KinkVerse, and Smash.

        <h2>How These Roles Connect To Smash</h2>
        <p>
          Not every role works on Smash protocol directly today. Some roles build brand trust, revenue capacity,
          product insight, and infrastructure readiness. Those are prerequisites for building durable social/protocol
          systems that communities can actually use.
