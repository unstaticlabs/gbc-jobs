          support <strong>SBFH</strong> with content and social execution,
          help build the <strong>Good Boys Club</strong> (GBC),
          shape <strong>KinkVerse</strong> (a social platform built for kinksters),

          and create a new <strong>media asset management solution for adult content creators</strong>.
          Some roles start as paid trials or part-time missions.
          Some are founder-track and equity-first.
          All of them contribute to one mission: <strong>building a free web for communities</strong>.

        <h2>What Is The Good Boys Club?</h2>
        <p>
          The Good Boys Club is a positive, affirming space for submissive men.
          GBC is a brand, a community, and a cultural platform.
          We build trust, shared taste, social signal, and belonging.
          The goal is a safe, fun, creative space of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why list non-GBC roles here?</strong>
          Because the DNA overlaps.
          If you belong here, you may also be exactly who we need to help shape the tools,
          products, and social infrastructure around it.

        <h2>The Bigger Vision</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Hey! I'm SBFH.</strong>
          I'm an engineer, a kinky sub boy, and a content creator.
          My main driver is freedom, and I'm building toward the next version of the internet:
          a free web for communities.
          My beliefs and values are well summarized in the "Fuck The VCs"
          <a href="https://fuckthevcs.com/#/manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">manifesto</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This journey will not be easy.
          We're going up against much bigger players.
          But we cannot win if we do not play.
          At least, we can have fun trying.
        </p>
        <p>
          It starts with claiming our humanity:
          building community and owning back our identities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to build a space online where we can be ourselves,
          and where we can be free.

            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Good Boys Club</strong> is home.
              This layer is not mainly about tech.
              It is about people, culture, safety, and belonging.
              We are building a positive, affirming space for submissive men.

            <h3>Social Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Smash</strong> is a 1:N messaging and curated content-sharing protocol.
              Users own their identities and data.
              With interoperable identity, they can join multiple <strong>neighborhoods</strong>.
              Like in the real world, neighborhoods are where people meet and communities form.

            <h3>Human Connection</h3>
            <p>
              Social networks became less and less social.
              <strong>KinkVerse</strong> aims to bring back human connection:
              a neighborhood built for kinksters, by kinksters.
              Long term, the KinkVerse's neighborhood governance should belong to the community.
              Enough of opportunistic capitalists taking over our communities and culture.

            <h3>Content Creation</h3>
            <p>
              Content creation is now a major part of the web.
              We are building tools that help creators become more resilient and own their content.
              A nice side effect: it also makes my life as a creator much easier.
